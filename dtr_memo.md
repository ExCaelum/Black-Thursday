## Black Thursday
### Parker Phillips, Lane Winham, Ryan Batty

* What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project?

> Parker would like to learn about CSV files and proper methods for manipulating them, git workflows, and ensure success within the program by attaining threes and fours.

> Lane would like to strengthen his fundamental understanding of Ruby and proper git workflows. He would also like to make sure he finishes, as that was a challenge for him on the prior projects.

> Ryan would like to use this project as a platform to increase his understanding of project management systems and tools, such as Waffle, GitHub, and general communication. He would also like to see high success on the project in order to finish the module on a strong note.

* When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?

> Our current plan is to work daily from 9am - 6pm, provided no other classes are occurring. Weekends will be decided on a per-individual basis, determined by prior engagements. Outside of the listed hours, project members are expected to work on assigned tasks via Waffle, and use remote partnering tools if/when necessary.


* How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?

> Primary communication will occur on campus, supplemented by Slack and ScreenHero. It is expected that all members keep a consistent presence on these tools in order to keep up to date on what's going on with the project.


* What is each group memberâ€™s self-identified strength(s) technically? What does each group member want to improve on technically? How can the team assist with these improvements?

> Parker: Parker feels very strong with his understanding of Ruby and TDD. He would like to further improve upon TDD and his ability to approach a given task confidently.

> Lane: Lane feels quite confident in his ability to break down a given problem into logical steps. He'd like to further improve on his Ruby fundamentals.

> Ryan: Ryan feels fairly well accomplished in Ruby and general TDD, Algorithms, and Data Structures. He would like to improve upon his ability to work within a team environment and best practice when it comes to Enumerables.

* Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?

> All team members would like to contribute wherever they can, though acknowledge there are some areas they feel stronger in than others. Each member is looking forward to using the project as a solid tool to improve themselves with.


* What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?

> All iterations will have their own branch, and each member will create sub-branches for individual features. When finished with a feature, the responsible member will create a pull request, and another member will merge it into that iteration branch. When all expected features in a given iteration are complete, the group as a whole will merge the iteration branch into master, provided all tests and spec harnesses pass after resolving any merge conflicts.

* What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?

> General communication is key. Members should maintain adequate usage of Google and Ruby Docs, while relying on other group members when possible.

* How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?

> We all prefer direct constructive criticism. Any issues should be brought up immediately in a professional manner, with the shared interest of mutual benefit in mind.

* Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?

> Parker will be unavailable to work on Sunday, and Ryan and Lane may have difficulty with weekends due to travel constraints.

* Additional Notes:

> Let's GOoOooooooOOOoooooooo!
